== Description ==

[RcVCite Homepage.](http://rcvcite.net)

RcVCite makes looking up bible verses on a website or blog fast and easy.
It is a Bible verse reference processor that locates verse references on any webpage.
It displays the content of that verse when you click on a reference or your mouse moves over the reference.

RcVCite retrieves verses by accessing a public API for the Text Only Edition of the Holy Bible Recovery Version published by Living Stream Ministry, Anaheim, CA;
the terms of use for this API may be viewed here.

RcVCite is in public beta which means it still may have problems to be worked out, but it is available for anyone to use.
